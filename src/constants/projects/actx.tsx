  overview: 'This application is a custom built internal CRM designed specifically for the operational needs of a tax and business consultancy firm. It centralizes client management and streamlines key services such as VAT filing, corporate tax registration, accounting, and audit reporting. The system includes robust role based access control, enabling administrators to invite users, assign roles, and configure granular permissions. The frontend is built with React and Next.js, while Supabase powers the backend, handling authentication, data storage, and real time updates.',
